# CarCost

CarCost is a RESTful API that aggregates used car data and information about these cars via the OpenAPI ChatGPT 3.5
AI model. It is built using Java, Spring Boot, Maven, MySQL and of course OpenAI's own RESTful API for ChatGPT. It obeys
standard REST principles, is designed using the Spring MVC design pattern, and returns data in an easily accessible JSON
format. Currently, this is just an API, but in the future I would like to add multiple webpages to actually view the
data, creating a complete used car listings website!
